    <string name="christmas_carol">A Christmas Carol is a novella by Charles Dickens, illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge,
        an elderly mister who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come.
    After their visits, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man. Dickens wrote the story during a period when the British were Exploring and re-evaluating
    past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as Christmas trees.</string>
